# Litter_Scramble
Unity project for Senior Capstone

This project was requested by the Army Corps of Engineers to serve as an educational experience for vistors to the Carters Lake Visitor Center. The game takes place in two unique park areas
and challenges the player to collect as much litter as possible before a time limit is reached.

The target end device to run this game is an Adnroid Tablet with 2gb of RAM and a Snapdragon 425 processor.

It was also requested that the images and text be reversed to allow the game to be presented on a Holofil holographic display.
